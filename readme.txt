 Complaint Management System - Work Report

1. Work Completed:
   - analyzed existing backend (Express + MongoDB).
   - Created a complete Frontend using React (Vite).
   - Implemented "Human Coded" Premium UI with custom CSS (no generic bootstrap/tailwind).
   - Created Authentication Pages (Login, Signup).
   - Created Dashboard with visual complaints status.
   - Created "File Complaint" form.
   - Configured API connection to Backend (localhost:5000).

2. How to Run:
   - Backend: Open terminal in 'server' folder and run `node server.js`
   - Frontend: Open terminal in 'client' folder and run `npm run dev`

3. Remaining Tasks (Future Scope):
   - Backend "Complaint" routes are not yet fully implemented/verified (Mock data used in Dashboard).
   - Connect "File Complaint" form to actual backend API endpoint (currently simulation).
   - Add Admin specific dashboard views.

The system is now ready for Login/Signup and visual walkthrough.
